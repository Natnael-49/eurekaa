    <h2 style="color: white;">Real Estate Investment</h2>
    <p class="aq">Real estate is one of the most desirable places to invest in. Real estate has long been considered a safe investment, whether you own, flip, or rent. If you have the money, you may want to expand your portfolio into the luxury real estate market.This is because people will always need a place to live in and they in general feel a desire to belong to a particular place. Which leads us to the conclusion that as long as human beings continue to exist, their demand for particular residence will exist. Ethiopia's current circumstance is very suitable for this type of investment as it is a highly developing country and this field is not explored to a significant state. But investment on such industry can be tricky and involves a certain risk associated with it. It is often required to have a professional consultancy or have an understanding of this sector. Investing in real estate is a great idea if you are in it for the long haul, not a quick return.
        Your best bet is investing in residential properties that produce rental income year-round. Just make sure you understand all of the associated legal fees and are prepared for unexpected costs. <br> Just to give an over view, the video below is recommended.</br></p> 
   <h2 style="color: white;" class="container1">Agricultural Investment</h2>
     <p class="aq"> Agriculture in Ethiopia is a very desirable sector to invest on. The first reason for this is that most of Ethiopia's land is primarily used for agriculture. This covers for more than 85% of Ethiopia's land. This could simply illustrate that there is an immense potential to prosper from agriculture. This leads us to our second reason. Ethiopia's development is strategized to emanate from agriculture. "Agriculture lead industrialization" is Ethiopia's motto. Plus, this sector hasn't been technologically manipulated. This opens the opportunity for emmense success with not-so-much investment. <br>  Commodity investors have been trading contracts for corn, cotton, hogs, cattle, soybeans, sugar and many other agriculture products for centuries. Futures offer investors an easy way to play price changes for agricultural products, without actually buying a farm and putting in all the hard work. That said, futures may be a bit intimidating for a beginner. It is best to learn about the market and study historical price movements before you venture in.</br></p>
    <h2 style="color:white">Industrial parks</h2>
    <p class="aq">An industrial park (also known as industrial estate, trading estate) is an area zoned and planned for the purpose of industrial development. An industrial park can be thought of as a more "heavyweight" version of a business park or office park, which has offices and light industry, rather than heavy industry. In Ethiopia it is just recently that the idea of industrial parks dawned on us. It hasn't been explored much and needs a great deal of support. The government also announced that the industrial parks built by the government are going to be privatized. This industries have been generating high amount of revenue in general and once privatized, they are expected to reach unprecedented heights. They require heavy investment; share companies or mutual funds can be an ideal option for this sector. </p>
